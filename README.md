# LLM Observatory

A hands-on lab to train, fine-tune, serve, and evaluate LLMs — from scratch to deployment.

## Goals
- Train a tiny 100–300M GPT from scratch
- Fine-tune a 7B with QLoRA
- Serve quantized models locally
- Add Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Evaluate and interpret results

## Getting Started
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd llm-observatory
make setup
